# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains notebooks and scripts for exploring and visualizing the charging station and OSM data.

## Notebooks

### 1. [eda_basic.ipynb](file:///home/joao-martins/Desktop/code/Enable%20Mobility/code/Enable/src/EDA/eda_basic.ipynb)
- **Purpose**: Initial data exploration of the MOBI.E station dataset.
- **Key Features**:
    - Descriptive statistics of charging types and power levels.
    - Basic geographic distribution check.
    - Identification of data quality issues (missing values, typos).

### 2. [eda_advanced.ipynb](file:///home/joao-martins/Desktop/code/Enable%20Mobility/code/Enable/src/EDA/eda_advanced.ipynb)
- **Purpose**: In-depth geospatial analysis and visualization.
- **Key Features**:
    - Heatmaps of station density.
    - Advanced visualizations comparing station availability across different regions.
    - Correlation analysis between station locations and urban density (if applicable).

## Scripts
- **`generate_advanced_eda.py`**: Automated script for generating standardized geospatial plots.
- **`generate_nb.py`**: Helper script for notebook generation or management.
